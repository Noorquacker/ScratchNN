# ScratchNN
A neural network written from scratch to learn about C++ classes and neural network architecture

Started in the Spring Break of my junior year of high school - right as corona hit (March 2020 in case you forgot)

## How to use

Well, you really don't. It's broken. I mean, I think the neural network mess works, but I couldn't figure out how to write text to the screen in SDL, so I stopped.

Yeah. That's about it.
